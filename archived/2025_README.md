# 👋 Hi, I’m Brice Nelson  

## 💼 Backend Developer | Fintech Engineer | Data-Driven Problem Solver  

🧠 *Engineer by training, Pythonista by passion, and a backend architect specializing in fintech infrastructure.*  
I build scalable systems that make financial data **actionable**, **trustworthy**, and **profitable** — because precision doesn’t stop at pipelines or portfolios. ☕
