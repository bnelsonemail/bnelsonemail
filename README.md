## 📊 Projects (Fintech & Data Science Highlights)

### [💰 Budget Forecast App](https://github.com/Brice-Financial-Projects/Financial-App)  
A full-stack budgeting application that allows users to input income, deductions, and track expenses across categories with auto-calculated tax withholding based on state selection. Deployed on Heroku with user registration, profile management, and dynamic dashboards.

- **Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap  
- **Features**: State tax logic, gross income frequency support, user session handling, and dynamic budget projections

### [📊 Retirement Forecast Simulator](https://github.com/bnelsonemail/Wealth_Journey_Projections)  
A Monte Carlo-powered wealth projection application that simulates retirement readiness based on user inputs like income, expenses, savings rate, and portfolio assumptions. Deployed at: 🌐 [www.retireforecast.com](https://www.retireforecast.com)

- **Stack**: Python, Flask, Matplotlib, Heroku  
- **Features**: Simulates thousands of retirement outcomes, visualizes retirement horizon, interactive front-end  
- **Goal**: Help users determine whether their retirement plan is on track or needs adjustment

---

### [🌍 Full Waveform Inversion ML (Coming Soon)]()  
A machine learning approach to subsurface imaging using seismic waveform data from the OpenFWI dataset. Predicts 2D velocity maps from noisy 4D waveforms. Built with competition constraints and professional-grade documentation.

- **Stack**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, DuckDB, PyTorch (planned)  
- **Features**: Modular codebase, DuckDB metadata layer, full EDA → preprocessing → modeling pipeline  

---

### [📈 Credit Default Risk Model (Coming Soon)](https://github.com/Brice-Data-Science/Credit-Risk-Assessment)  
A binary classification model to assess credit default risk using the UCI dataset. Designed with explainability and real-world deployment in mind.

- **Focus**: EDA, SHAP interpretability, modular pipelines  
- **Deployment Goal**: Flask API + interactive dashboard  

---

### [📘 Pencils & Python: Derivatives in the Real World](https://github.com/Pencils-and-Python/Pencils-Python-Derivatives)  
A blog-linked repo for my *Pencils & Python* educational series, where I explore mathematical finance concepts (like derivatives and continuous compounding) using Python.

- **Focus**: Real-world finance meets code — Black-Scholes, calculus-based modeling, risk metrics  
- **Blog**: [Medium: QuantShift](https://medium.com/@quantshift)
