- 👋 Hi, I’m @bnelsonemail (Brice)
- 👀 I’m interested in skeet shooting, going to the beach with my dogs, sailing, and fishing to name a few.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, javascript, and html.  I am enrolled in a full stack bootcamp starting in April 2024.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming projects for now.  I want to learn through experience.
- 📫 How to reach me by email: bnelsonemail@icloud.com
- 😄 Pronouns: I don't use pronouns
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have lived in extremes.  I have lived as far south as West Palm Beach and as far north as Minot ND.  I experienced a wind chill of -78 with a temp of -35 in ND.
