## 🚀 Projects
Here are some of my recent projects:
### [Gallow Guess] (https://github.com/bnelsonemail/Gallows-Guess)
A web application to play a game of Hangman.
This application is currently in development.

- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM Manipulation.
- **Features:** Start Screen, Random Generation of Words in an Array, Displays Guesses and Correct Letters Display.

### [Cognitive Quest] (https://github.com/bnelsonemail/Cognitive-Quest)
A web application to play a Memory Game.
This application was inspired by my dogs.  My chocolate lab had to be euthanized just as I started working on this application.

- **Encountered Bugs:** To prevent the card from flipping after it was a match.  The following turn would allow the user to click on a matched card and it would flip back, which also lost a turn in the process.  Even though JavaScript was disabling the cards, it did not hold.  This was resolved by placing matched cards in another class and disabling the class in CSS.
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Features:** The game has a start screen to begin the game.  The game provides a counter of remaining moves and a score, along with a restart.
