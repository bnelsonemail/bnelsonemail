### 📈 [HedgeForge: Portfolio Risk Modeling Engine (In Progress)](https://github.com/Brice-Financial-Projects/HedgeForge)

A Python-based quantitative finance project that simulates and optimizes long-term portfolio performance using stochastic processes and Monte Carlo simulations. HedgeForge is designed for institutional use cases like asset-liability management (ALM) and economic scenario generation (ESG), with emphasis on reproducible modeling and scenario stress testing.

**Stack**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Quarto, Git (Streamlit and cvxpy planned)  
**Features**:
- Monte Carlo simulation of asset paths (GBM, mean-reverting, multi-asset correlation)  
- Portfolio optimization using mean-variance and utility-based frameworks  
- Historical and synthetic strategy backtesting  
- Scenario stress testing and risk exposure modeling  
- Transparent documentation using Quarto  

**Status**: In early development with focus on simulation engine and optimization module

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

I'm pursuing **quant developer** and **quantitative analyst** roles where I can:

- Build and optimize financial models (and make them *sing* with Python).  
- Apply ML & statistical thinking to real market and risk challenges.  
- Push code that matters in high-stakes, fast-paced environments.

## 🤖 Fun Fact

I’ve engineered both municipal infrastructure and Monte Carlo simulations—because pipelines and portfolios both demand precision. 🏗️ ➔ 📈
