# 👋 Hi, I’m Brice Nelson

## 💼 Applied Machine Learning & Backend Engineer | Systems-Focused Problem Solver

🧠 *Engineer by training, Pythonista by practice, and builder of production-grade systems where data, models, and software meet.*
I specialize in **applied machine learning** and **backend engineering**, turning messy real-world data into **reliable systems** and **defensible decisions**—from infrastructure analytics to financial risk modeling.

I don’t treat ML as notebooks in isolation. I build **ML as software**. ☕

## 🧩 Featured Projects

### 🛠️ Toronto Pipeline Failure Prediction — Applied ML & Infrastructure Risk System

[https://github.com/Brice-Machine-Learning/Toronto-Pipeline-Failure-Predict](https://github.com/Brice-Machine-Learning/Toronto-Pipeline-Failure-Predict)

A real-world **applied machine learning project** focused on predicting **water main failure risk** using public infrastructure, environmental, and asset data from the City of Toronto. The project is intentionally designed as the foundation for a **deployable, decision-support system**, not a standalone model.

This work prioritizes **data realism**, **engineering constraints**, and **defensible modeling decisions**, reflecting the realities faced by municipal utilities where data is incomplete, heterogeneous, and operationally constrained.

**Status:** 🟢 Active development
**Core Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Geo-enabled datasets, Quarto

_**Applied ML Focus**

* Asset-level feature engineering (installation year, material, diameter, environmental exposure)
* Spatial and temporal aggregation of infrastructure and failure data
* Failure labeling under incomplete and inconsistent municipal records
* Model evaluation aligned with risk prioritization, not academic metrics
* Explicit handling of uncertainty and data limitations

_**Systems & Backend Direction (In Progress / Planned)**

* Backend service to operationalize risk scoring and model inference
* Secure authentication and role-based access for internal and stakeholder users
* API endpoints for asset-level risk queries and scenario analysis
* Dashboard integration for infrastructure risk visualization (Power BI or equivalent BI tooling)
* Deployment-focused design emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and model versioning

_**Engineering Philosophy**

* ML treated as a system component, not a notebook artifact
* Clear separation between data processing, modeling logic, and serving layers
* Design decisions driven by how results will be consumed by engineers, planners, and decision-makers

**Goal:** Deliver an applied ML–driven infrastructure risk system that bridges modeling, backend services, and operational dashboards—demonstrating end-to-end thinking from raw municipal data to deployable decision support.

A **FastAPI-powered backend platform** for querying, aggregating, and analyzing civil bid-item pricing across large datasets, with a clear roadmap toward **applied machine learning–driven cost analytics**. Built for engineers, analysts, and decision-makers who need structured, defensible insights from infrastructure cost data.

**Status:** ⚙️ In Progress
**Core Stack:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, JWT Authentication, AWS RDS

_**Current Capabilities (Backend-First)**

* Hierarchical domain models (Projects → Items → Costs)
* High-performance REST APIs for cost queries and filtering
* Secure authentication and role-aware data access
* Schema design optimized for analytical workloads

_**Applied ML Roadmap**

* Cost trend modeling and normalization across projects and regions
* Anomaly detection for outlier bid items and pricing inconsistencies
* Feature engineering on historical bid data (time, location, scope)
* Predictive cost ranges to support early-stage planning

_**Engineering Focus**

* Clean service boundaries and API design
* Data integrity and query performance at scale
* ML-ready data pipelines built on a stable backend foundation

**Goal:** Deliver a production-ready backend system that evolves into an applied ML–enabled cost analytics platform for infrastructure decision support.
