### [📈 Credit Default Risk Model (Coming Soon)](https://github.com/Brice-Data-Science/Credit-Risk-Assessment)  
A binary classification model to assess credit default risk using the UCI dataset. Designed with explainability and real-world deployment in mind.

- **Focus**: EDA, SHAP interpretability, modular pipelines  
- **Deployment Goal**: Flask API + interactive dashboard  

---

### [📘 Pencils & Python: Derivatives in the Real World](https://github.com/Pencils-and-Python/Pencils-Python-Derivatives)  
A blog-linked repo for my *Pencils & Python* educational series, where I explore mathematical finance concepts (like derivatives and continuous compounding) using Python.

- **Focus**: Real-world finance meets code — Black-Scholes, calculus-based modeling, risk metrics  
- **Blog**: [Medium: QuantShift](https://medium.com/@quantshift)

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

I'm pursuing **quant developer** and **quantitative analyst** roles where I can:

- Build and optimize financial models (and make them *sing* with Python).  
- Apply ML & statistical thinking to real market and risk challenges.  
- Push code that matters in high-stakes, fast-paced environments.

## 🤖 Fun Fact

I’ve engineered both municipal infrastructure and Monte Carlo simulations—because pipelines and portfolios both demand precision. 🏗️ ➔ 📈
