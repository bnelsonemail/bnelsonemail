## 📊 Projects (Fintech & Data Science Highlights)

### [💰 Budget Forecast App](https://github.com/Brice-Financial-Projects/Financial-App)
A full-stack budgeting application that allows users to input income, deductions, and track expenses across categories with auto-calculated tax withholding based on state selection. Deployed on Heroku with user registration, profile management, and dynamic dashboards.

- **Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap
- **Features**: State tax logic, gross income frequency support, user session handling, and dynamic budget projections.
- **In Progress**: Adding Monte Carlo simulation for retirement forecasting.

---

### [🌍 Full Waveform Inversion ML (Coming Soon)]()
A machine learning approach to subsurface imaging using seismic waveform data from the OpenFWI dataset. Predicts 2D velocity maps from noisy 4D waveforms. Built with competition constraints and production-grade documentation.

- **Stack**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, DuckDB, PyTorch (planned)
- **Features**: Modular codebase, DuckDB metadata layer, full EDA → preprocessing → modeling pipeline

---

### [📈 Credit Default Risk Model (Coming Soon)](https://github.com/Brice-Data-Science/Credit-Risk-Assessment)
A binary classification model to assess credit default risk using the UCI dataset. Designed with explainability and real-world deployment in mind.

- **Focus**: EDA, SHAP interpretability, modular pipelines
- **Deployment Goal**: Flask API + interactive dashboard

---

### [📘 Pencils & Python: Derivatives in the Real World](https://github.com/Pencils-and-Python/Pencils-Python-Derivatives)
A blog-linked repo for my *Pencils & Python* educational series, where I explore mathematical finance concepts (like derivatives and continuous compounding) using Python.

- **Focus**: Real-world finance meets code — Black-Scholes, calculus-based modeling, risk metrics
- **Blog**: [Medium: QuantShift](https://medium.com/@quantshift)
