## 🚀 Projects
Here are some of my recent projects:
### [Mad Lib Magic] (https://github.com/bnelsonemail/Mad-Lib-Magic)
A web application using Python and Flask to allow the user to choose words in a form and then provide a random short story using the user's chosen words.
This application has been hosted and can be seen at the following location: https://mad-lib-magic-bnelson.replit.app/
This application is currently being enhanced in development.

- **Tech Stack:** HTML, Tailwind Python, & Flask.
- **Features:** Start Screen, capture of data from form submission and applied to the program, random generation of stories which implement in the data submitted.
-  **Enhancements in Development:** Links on start screen to allow the user to choose the theme.  Individualized forms for each theme.  Added many stories to be randomized for each theme.  Flask is incorporating a vast number of files for the incoporation of the enhancements.

### [Cognitive Quest] (https://github.com/bnelsonemail/Cognitive-Quest)
A web application to play a Memory Game.
This application was inspired by my dogs.  My chocolate lab had to be euthanized just as I started working on this application.

- **Encountered Bugs:** To prevent the card from flipping after it was a match.  The following turn would allow the user to click on a matched card and it would flip back, which also lost a turn in the process.  Even though JavaScript was disabling the cards, it did not hold.  This was resolved by placing matched cards in another class and disabling the class in CSS.
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Features:** The game has a start screen to begin the game.  The game provides a counter of remaining moves and a score, along with a restart.
